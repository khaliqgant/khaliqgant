<h1 id="sonorwaywhatsthatlike">So…Norway, what's that like?!</h1>
<p>Yes, I’ve moved to Oslo, Norway as of end of December 2016. It was a whirlwind
of a move at the end of the year so I am just now having a chance to catch my
breath and….blog (not that I’ve been active anyway, but I digress).</p>
<p>When I tell someone that I live in Norway, the reaction is often one of
bewilderment. It’s almost as if they’re trying to figure out where the hell
in the United States is Norway.</p>
<p>Since I’ve had this conversation so many times, I’m going to list out a Q&amp;A
of sorts of the common questions I get and the answers I normally give:</p>
<p>Why did you move to Norway?
My finacée is Norwegian and so I moved to join here there. We have been doing
long distance for two and a half years so it was time. I’ve always wanted to
live abroad so this was the perfect time.</p>
<p>So how has such a big move been?
Honestly, pretty easy. Everything has been pretty smooth. I knew I was going
to move dating back to the beginning of the year so I have been preparing for
it all year for the most part. Things in Oslo are pretty efficient so it was
super easy to get settled. Plus my fiancée has been a great guide/translator to
help me get settled. Also with views like this, it’s hard to complain:</p>
