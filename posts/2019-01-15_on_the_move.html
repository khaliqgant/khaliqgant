<h1 id="onthemove">On the move</h1>
<p>This past August I moved again with my wife (we got married a year ago) from
Oslo to Paris. Do I speak French? Noâ€¦.but Iâ€™m working on it! I do want to keep
up my Norwegian since we have plans on going back to Oslo but the French in
general donâ€™t speak English as well as the Norwegians <a href="https://www.ef.no/epi/">(source)</a>
do so Iâ€™m going to focus on my French.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m still with Vector Media Group and my role has transitioned from Head of
Development, Norway to Head of Development, Europe and Iâ€™m looking to expand
our operations into Europe in general and will try to make some progress in
France in particular. We have some really great <a href="https://www.vectormediagroup.com/experience/norwegian-web-development">clients</a>
in Norway and Iâ€™m really proud of the progress we have made there.</p>
<p>It was a busy but productive year as had to prepare for the move, I traveled
quite a bit speaking at conferences in both Lille, France and Nashville,
Tennessee and the Take Off Conference and <a href="https://2018.eeconf.com/">EE Conference</a> respectively. This
coming year I am really looking forward to being a mentor at the <a href="https://www.instituteofcode.com/">Institute
of Code</a> which should be an amazing experience.</p>
<p>We plan on being in Paris for three years which I like to call three years of
vacation, because living in Paris is kind of like a dream. Of course there are
challenges - making a network, learning how to navigate French culture with
limited French language skills and in general adjusting to a new place. That
being said, we live very close to the Eiffel tower, are a short bike ride to
the city center and can have delicious baguettes any day we want.
So, so far so good ðŸ˜€ðŸ¥–.</p>
