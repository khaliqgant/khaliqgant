# KDW ðŸ”¥
Every week (or ever other week) I compile a playlist of about 8-12 songs that
I'm digging called KDW ðŸ”¥. Check it out on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6KGPUOEqz4uirNH3MILuB8" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.
Want to read more about how I build out this playlist? Check out the [methodology post ðŸ¤“](/curations/kdw-methodology).

# Dev Diaries
I run a website called <a href="https://www.dev-diaries.com/" target="_blank">Dev Diaries</a>
where I write about web development and share tips about development.

# Foursquare Lists
I enjoy traveling and have put together a series of lists that I often share with
friends. You can find them on <a href="https://foursquare.com/khaliqgant/lists/created" target="_blank">Foursquare.</a>
