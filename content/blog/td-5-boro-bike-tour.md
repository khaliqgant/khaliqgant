The bike tour is a 50 mile bike tour around, you guessed it, the five boro’s. It is a fun, crotch killing time. Last time I rode a bike I was doing a different bike tour, except that one was 100 miles in October. Needless to say sitting down tomorrow will be uncomfortable.

I try to do things like this that both challenge me and take me out of my comfort zone. I do the #insanity workout 4 times a week, so it’s good to switch it up and hop on a bike. “Comfort breeds mediocrity,” and this was a fun reminder to myself to not get too comfortable.
