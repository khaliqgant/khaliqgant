As I'm _sure you noticed_ I redid my website -- it was long overdue. In the process
I'm also migrating from my old tumblr blog at https://blog.khaliqgant.com to this
self hosted blog. Therefore there is a larger gap in my posts than there should be.
Once I finish migrating there will _still_ be a large gap between my blog posts
but...less so...
