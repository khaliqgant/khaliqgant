As the title suggests, I haven't been paying too much attention to my blog of late. I'm going to try to remedy that....starting tomorrow! Kidding, starting now with this short and wishful post.&nbsp;

A lot has happened since my last post. Looking through my blog I don't think i ever mentioned that I joined [Vector Media Group](http://www.vectormediagroup.com/)&nbsp;as a developer! (I joined two years ago to give you a sense of how dated my blog is -- I swear I'll be more active, I swear!).

Another important thing to note is that I started taking Computer Science classes at Columbia University, my Columbia sponsored [website](http://www.columbia.edu/~kjg2150/) if you don't believe me. My eventual goal is to get a Masters in Computer Science, so yay(!) for student loans and being in perpetual debt (still paying off Cornell debt).

Anyway, I have learned a lot when it comes to development, and have come a long way from my "[learning to code](/blog/5-things-i-learned-while-learning-how-to-code)" days. The exciting part of that is that I have a ton more to learn. I've heard the saying, the more you learn, the more you learn what you don't know. That certainly rings true especially as I've been taking classes in the incredibly dense field of Computer Science.

Thanks for reading and look for more posts soon!
