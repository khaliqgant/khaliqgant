So my birthday was on Sunday. Let me just say that I have great friends and had a fantastic birthday. This year for some reason I didn't feel like planning anything just kind of wanted to wing it. A year off, so to speak. I will be planning a lot of things in the very near future so I figured I'd take a break for now.

A lot of exciting things happening in my life now.
