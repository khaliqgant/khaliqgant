At the end of 2016 [I moved to Oslo, Norway](/blog/so-norway-whats-that-like/) with my then girlfriend and now wife.
In order to obtain residency there it is mandatory that you learn Norwegian
and they offer language courses to assist with that process. Prior to moving
I had taken some
<a href="https://www.sps.nyu.edu/professional-pathways/courses/SCAN1-CE9301-norwegian-i.html" target="_blank">courses at NYU</a>
so I had some base level Norwegian. Learning a language casually while living
in a different country versus learning a language while living in that country
is vastly different. It is easy to just do the homework go to class but otherwise
forget about it. Contrarily, when you're surrounded by the language and with other
students who are highly motivated because their residence depends on it brings a certain...
intensity.

No matter how you slice it however, learning a foreign language is tough. Bottom line,
it takes a lot of time and practice. It is uncomfortable not being able to express
yourself especially when you have been able to so clearly express yourself in your
native tongue. It is very easy to try and just say what you want in your mother tongue
rather than stumble and sputter through it in an uncomfortable language. However, to
improve you have to do just that and do that all the time. Being in an motivated environment
with other students and a passionate teacher really helped me learn Norwegian
quite quickly. I was able to learn Norwegian at a much quicker pace in Norway than I did
while in NYC. This might seem obvious but I cannot stress how much the learning environment
helped. In addition, speaking Norwegian out in the real world helped, but the problem
in Norway is that so many people speak English so well you can easily get by
with just knowing how to speak English.

In 2018, I moved to [Paris, France](/blog/on-the-move/) and so I did the same thing -
started taking French classes while still living in Norway and then once I arrived
took classes in a structured class environment. The huge difference is that
in general the French don't speak English as well and don't switch as easily to
English as they did in Norway. Starting completely over in another language
was difficult and also when I tried to speak French, the Spanish I took in high school
and college tried to come out which was...confusing. Then, at other times
Norwegian would come out when I wanted to speak French. On the whole I would say French is a tougher
language to learn than Norwegian and trying to speak French in Paris is a bit
different because of the busy and fast pace nature of the city. For comparison
I imagine trying to speak broken English to a busy cab driver in NYC would not get
you very far and the cab drivers patience would dissipate very quickly.

The other thing you have to swallow when learning a language is your pride. There are
going to be plenty of embarrassing moments and plenty of moments where you just
can't find the right words. Of course, 10 minutes later you know exactly what you
_should_ have said, but in that moment you feel like an idiot.

When I hear someone is fluent in a language I am immediately impressed because
I know how much time and effort that takes. I'm not fluent in Norwegian or French, but I can
hold my own in Norwegian and have a conversation and I can _get by_ in French with
a fairly basic conversation, but I have a long ways to go. Some days I feel super
confident in French and feel like I'm making progress and other days I realize how little
I really know and how much further I have to go. However, that is just the process
of learning a language and learning in general.

I'm thankful that I'm able to take language lessons fairly easily with sites such as
<a href="https://www.verbling.com/" target="_blank">Verbling</a> and
with <a href="https://www.alliancefr.org/">Alliance Fran√ßaise</a> now
offering online courses along with <a href="https://www.folkeuniversitetet.no/Spraakkurs?geo=off" target="_blank">Folkeuniversitetet</a>.
I have been able to easily to find language courses in a private tutoring or classroom environment
with whatever fits my schedule.

Overall, I'm happy I've had the opportunity to learn multiple languages and look forward
to more embarrassing moments and the moments where I impress myself with
how far I've come.
