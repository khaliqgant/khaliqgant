_This post is part of a new series called, "#BroBlogging." Check out Will Washburn's post on the same topic (__[here](http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/23757440796/why-i-go-to-facebook-com)__)._

_----------_

Well, first off, I don't really go to Facebook.com much at all. When it first came out back in the good old days of 2004, I used to go out all the time. The network was small enough that I could check out classmates, see people that I didn't actually know yet but recognized and coordinate weekend plans with friends. Now days it feels bloated, I have wayyy too many friends (I'm not that cool) and most of the people that pop up in my feed I don't care about. However, those are the people who's profiles that I go to most often. The people I do care about, I hardly ever visit their Facebook page. Because I either see them or talk to them that I don't feel the need to visit their page.

So the people I don't really care about that much I end up going to their page more often and then after I finish I kind of feel like I wasted my time. Facebook can be used as a "soft" (read: creepy/stalkerish) way to keep tabs of someone. The other way is to actually reach out to them to find out how they are. Now, some people I don't deem worth the effort to reach out to them, so in that instance Facebook is useful. Then again if I don't care about them enough to reach out to them in the first place why check their page at all? Human curiosity? Honestly I don't know, but apparently I care enough to be curious to what they're doing.

So let's review:

**1st Level Friends (Closest Friends)**

- Roommates, Girlfriend.

Hardly ever check their page because I know what is going on in their life

**2nd Level Friends (Close Friends)**

- Former teammates, would meet for a drink to catch up with etc

Hardly check their page either, but more likely to check because I don't talk to them as often and I care about them

**3rd Level Friends (Friends)**

- Former classmates. Someone I might go to dinner with in a group or go out with on a Saturday night or something.&nbsp;

Might go to their page, but still not very likely.

**Acquaintances**

&nbsp;- We're friends on Facebook but not really good friends

I go to their page most often, yet I probably don't even really care that much about what they're doing

So basically in a nutshell that is why I don't feel the need to go to Facebook.com that much and when I do, I don't really feel like I gained much. Because I am mostly checking out people that I don't really care about.

Is my Facebook experience much different that yours? Let me know because I'm&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;curious. Maybe I'm weird in how I use Facebook, I don't know.&nbsp;
