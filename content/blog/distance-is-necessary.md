Stay too close to something and you start to not being able to see it as clearly after a while.

What sparked this thought?

Yesterday I was struggling with writing some code, trying to figure out why it wasn't working. So I decided to take a break and go grab a beer with a few friends and watch the Lakers/OKC. I opened it up this morning and voila! I immediately saw the problem and fixed it in less than 10 seconds.

I was looking at the code the same way and overlooking the same mistake over and over. It was that separation from what I was working on that allowed me to see it clearly and stop missing the same mistake. I guess the larger theme I'm touching on is having balance in my life which I've written about before ([Staying Grounded](/blog/staying-grounded "Staying Ground")).

Even something as small as you find yourself not being productive or just banging your head against a wall, sometimes it's good to fight through it. Also sometimes it might be better to take a break or move onto something else.

I often notice that my best thoughts and ideas come to me while I'm in the shower. I think that's because I'm not actively thinking about what I'm working on and give my brain a chance to breathe so to speak. My brain kind of wanders and then all of sudden I get a sudden attack of inspiration.

So let your mind wander sometimes and don't be afraid to take a break, it might be just what you need.
