I'll admit it, when I first heard about Twitter a) I thought it was kind of a stupid idea and b) I didn't think I would have anything to say. If you follow me (@khaliqgant) I think you'll see if tweet fairly regularly and within reason, I'm pretty public with my formerly private thoughts.

So what happened?

I found my voice.

At first, I had no idea what to say. I'm not one to tweet, "Just finished going to the bathroom, made sure to wash my hands, LOL." If I ever tweet that, someone please slap me. I attempt to be creative, funny and witty (CFW) and probably fail at each, but in the process I found my voice.

I became comfortable expressing myself and became confident enough to try to be CFW, even if I wasn't at all. And if people thought I wasn't, then so what, they could unfollow me. As I tweeted more frequently I found it easier to express myself and my voice started coming out more and more. I found my emails became funnier (or so I thought) and my texts more interesting. As a whole I became much more comfortable with written communication. And I think tweeting started all that.

Tweeting also has helped make blogging easier. Blog posts to me are extended versions of tweets. They're probably a bit more repetitive and I'm a firm believer that there is a certain beauty in being concise (pretty sure I tweeted that). However I think if done correctly blogging is the next step. As I blog more often I think I will find my voice even more and also find my analytical voice. I hope as I blog more frequently I'll become better at expressing myself and hopefully in the process say something interesting.

So here's to blogging more often and being CFW - or at least attempting to.
