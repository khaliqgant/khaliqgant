When you're heavily invested in something it's easy to lose track of what's going on around you. I think maintaining a sense of perspective and being grounded is important not only to your well being but also your sanity. Being obsessed with something and working hard at it is different than blocking out everything else and losing sight of what's important.

There is a fine line, no doubt - but I think it's important to have people around you who can help you find the right balance. There should definitely be a balance. I often notice that I have some of my best insights when I'm not working but doing something random or I'm relaxing. When I run to the nearest white board or note pad my girlfriend knows what's going on. Leisure activities, working out, reading books, EATING (which I have forgotten to do) are all important to renew energy, help you be focused later, and generally lead a healthy life. I'm a pretty obsessive person and can get very caught up in things which is why I'm thankful for having people around that keep me in line. You know who you are, and I thank you for that.
